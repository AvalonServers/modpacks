Ascent: Block One is an upcoming, highly ambitious Fabric 1.18.1 pack aiming to permanently solve the kind of previous lag issues with Frozen Hell, while also futureproofing the world for construction purposes for at least five years.

The theme is surviving in a large tower-based arcology, where city construction is vertical instead of horizontal. Due to this, stacked bases will always be loaded, so optimisation is especially important.
