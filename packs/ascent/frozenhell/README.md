Ascent: Frozen Hell is a "revamp" of the Descent: Frozen Hell pack, aiming to optimise its performance and starting again with a new world, with further spaced out cities.

Although being as ambitious as its predecessor, it has as of yet failed to gain as much traction among its previous playerbase, in part because of the reset causing demotivation.
