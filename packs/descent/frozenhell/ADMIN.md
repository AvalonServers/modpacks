## Mods that should not be updated
- CreativeCore (breaks multiblocks)
- Railcraft (causes crash on start due to a conflict with computronics)
- RailcraftTweaker (pinned to Railcraft version)
- OpenComputers (1.8.4 introduces an exception handler regression)

## Known issues
- SpongeForge's jarfile must be prefixed with `_a` due to another mod that applies an old mixin, causing a conflict.
