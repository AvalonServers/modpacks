# Installation

1. Download [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org). Other launchers, including PolyMC, MultiMC and Curse are not supported and will not work with the pack.
2. Go to Add Instance -> Import.
3. Paste the following link into the field: https://s3.eu-west-1.wasabisys.com/parallax-assets/packs/mmc/descent-frozenhell.zip
4. Click OK. An entry in the launcher for Descent: Frozen Hell will be created.

## Using OptiFine

Notice: OptiFine is recommended for use if you are encountering performance issues in areas such as Perkelgrad, but can cause issues with other mods and is hence not supported. To enable OptiFine, launch the pack and select it in the "optional mods" section before the game starts (you can select either regular or preview).
