Frozen Hell is a large general-purpose themed 1.12.2 pack centered around the concept of survival in a frozen wasteland where resources were scarce. The map, built in a world generation program, was designed by Oskutin. Crafting recipes were also modified with CraftTweaker in order to make certain recipes harder.

A short period into Frozen Hell, both BetterWithMods (BWM) and Tough as Nails were removed, which made the pack a lot easier.

~~The server eventually shut down due to lag problems. Many large tech mods with multiple addons (Thermal Expansion, Industrial Foregoing, Immersive Engineering, Ender IO) plus the sheer density of the large chunkloaded areas made for consistent framerates below 15 FPS and the server not being above 10 TPS.~~
As of 24/06/2023 the server has been revived with many updates to its mods and performance tweaks to make the pack no longer unplayable. It has also been migrated to new, faster, and more stable hardware.

## Mods that should not be updated
- CreativeCore (breaks multiblocks)
- Immersive Technology (removes coke ovens)
- Railcraft (causes crash on start due to a conflict with computronics)

## Known issues
- SpongeForge's jarfile must be prefixed with `_a` due to another mod that applies an old mixin, causing a conflict.
