## Abstract

This ACP proposes a policy for the disablement of long-distance transfer devices.

## Motivation

Long-distance transfer devices, such as tesseracts and AE2 Quantum Bridges, bypass the railway system and make such systems redundant. They are also also unreliable (especially in the case of AE2) and make network more complicated than they should be.

## Specification

Such devices will be disabled via either the use of configuration options or CraftTweaker scripts. The non-exhaustive list of devices that should be disabled is as follows:
- Ender IO Tesseracts
- OpenComputers Link Cards
- AE2 Quantum Network Bridges
