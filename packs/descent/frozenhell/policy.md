# Server Rules

These are the rules for the Avalon: Frozen Hell pack servers (including Descent, Ascent and Community Creative).

1. All players must abide by the Loiste Community server rules and the Avalon Servers Acceptable Use Policy.
2. Fairness
    - Players may not steal from each other.
    - Players may not damage a structure belonging to other players without permission.
    - Players may not cause any other type of unrecoverable loss (for example, deleting OpenComputers code).
    - The preceding rules are void if both parties are At War.
    - Accidental violations do not result in a penalty.
3. Abuse
    - Intentionally attempting to lag or crash the server is not permitted.
    - Exploits must be reported to staff immediately and use of one is strictly forbidden.
    - Server staff may not use their privileges to gain an unfair gameplay advantage.
        - Staff may teleport themselves, as long as this privilege is not overused.
4. Banned Items
    - Items may be disabled by server staff and made uncraftable or unobtainable.
        - These may include items that give unfair advantages, disrupt balance, or crash or lag the server.
    - Items disabled as such will be clearly marked in JEI with a red tooltip.
    - Attempting to obtain or use such items is strictly forbidden.
5. Performance
    - All players must be considerate of others' experience on the server and ensure they are mindful of performance issues they may cause with their builds.
    - All players must be mindful with their use of chunk loaders, detailed in Rule 8.
    - Tiquality is used to balance server performance fairly between players and is enforced on everyone, including staff.
        - Players are responsible for ensuring their builds are claimed correctly (with `/tq info` and `/tq claim`) so that they will tick.
6. PvP
    - PvP is generally prohibited (except in a playful sense), unless multiple parties have officially Declared War.
    - In a declaration of war, all parties must submit to staff their intention and war goals. The request is subject to rejection if the risk of collateral damage to builds is deemed too high. Staff cannot approve their own wars.
    - Weapons of war (i.e. explosives) must not damage structures within Build Restricted Areas at any time. Minor accidental damage must be repaired at the expense of the attacking party, and major damage must stop the war immediately.
7. Territories and Parties
    - A *territory* is a region of land claimed by a party.
        - In order to be claimed, territories must stake some sort of physical presence. This includes at least one structure.
            - This rule does not apply to pre-existing structures as of the creation of this rule (Tue 6 Aug 2024)
    - Parties are players or groups of players that can control *territories*.
        - Parties have the ability to establish official *borders* that claim all land inside as their territory.
            - The designation of official borders are subject to moderator approval to prevent overlap and disputes.
            - Borders can be expanded by the construction of meaningful *infrastructure*, including roads, tunnels, train tracks and above-ground power lines.
            - Borders obey the X and Z axes only, which means all underground space will be implicitly claimed when borders are designated.
                - Subsurface bases owned by different parties can be claimed and exempted from borders.
8. Chunk Loading
    - The only permitted mechanism of keeping chunks continuously loaded is ChickenChunks Chunk Loaders.
        - Railcraft Worldspikes may be used solely for loading Railcraft trains and Railcraft track segments.
        - Railcraft Admin Worldspikes may be requested for certain critical, shared areas that need to be chunkloaded 24/7.
            - Approval or denial of the request is subject to moderator discretion.
            - Admin Worldspikes can be placed and broken only by staff. Attempting to obtain them as an unauthorised player will be subject to the same penalties as Banned Items.
    - There are no defined limits for how many chunk loaders you may own; however you should use common sense and keep server performance in mind.
        - Spot Loaders are preferable over full Chunk Loaders as they allow finer control of loaded areas.
        - If staff determine chunk loaders are being over-used they are authorised to either remove them or reconfigure them to be more performant.
    - Chunk Loaders are a privilege. Abuse may result in this privilege being withdrawn.
    - After a week, personal Chunk Loaders will cease functioning. They will reset after logging on. This restriction cannot be altered by staff.
9. Build Quality
    - Parties may designate any area within their borders with a required standard of construction. They are also entitled to prohibit all construction unless authorised by them.
    - Construction in these areas is regulated and must meet a certain standard of quality. The exact definition is left up to owner discretion, but guidelines include:
        - Realism of the build (i.e. making use of Immersive Engineering scaffolds to provide a believable expectation of structural integrity)
        - Detailing/Tidiness (i.e. not building factories in a cobblestone cave underground)
        - Style Conformance (i.e. not deviating from the building style in a styled area, unless a lore-friendly reason why is given)
    - If a land owner determines a player is violating the construction standards within their borders, they may ask a moderator to approve removal of the build.
        - The purpose of moderator approval is to prevent later dispute of removals, which would require restoring a potentially complex build.
        - If approval is given, the land owner may then remove the build. They must leave the materials in a chest for the builder to collect.
            - Theft of construction materials will be treated as a violation of Rule 2 and dealt with accordingly.
