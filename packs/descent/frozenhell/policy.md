# Server Policy

This document outlines the policy to be enforced on the official Descent: Frozen Hell server.

1. All players must abide by the Loiste Community server rules and the Avalon Servers Acceptable Use Policy.
2. Chunk Loading
    - The only permitted mechanism of keeping chunks continuously loaded is Railcraft Worldspikes.
    - Standard and Passive worldspikes will require fuel that cannot be piped in.
    - Admin worldspikes may be requested for certain critial areas.
        - The (non-comprehensive) list of areas is defined as:
            - Power plants
            - AE2 Controller rooms
            - OpenComputers server rooms
        - Worldspike requests are ultimately up to admin discretion.
        - Misue of granted worldspikes (i.e. using them to load factory areas) can result in them being withdrawn.
3. Build Quality
    - Certain areas on the map may be designated as "Build Restricted Areas". Individual player bases that are completely disconnected from main areas may not be designated.
    - Construction in these areas is regulated and must meet a certain standard of quality. The exact definition is left up to moderator discretion, but guidelines include:
        - Realism of the build (i.e. making use of Immersive Engineering scaffolds to provide a believable expectation of structural integrity)
        - Detailing/Tidiness (i.e. not building factories in a cobblestone cave underground)
        - Style Conformance (i.e. not deviating from the building style in a styled area, unless a lore-friendly reason why is given)
    - If a moderator determines a player is violating this policy, they can be asked to remove their build. If they do not comply, moderators are empowered to manually remove their build and place the construction materials in a chest.
    - Countries can designate protected build areas and requirements for that area. If the country judges a building in a designated area to not conform to requirements, they can refer it to moderators to deal with as a breach of server policy.
    - This policy does not apply to any constructions created before it first came into effect.
    - The current list of Build Restricted Areas includes:
        - Valley Forest
        - Perkelgrad (excluding underground areas and Deep Tube)
        - Sorvi
4. PvP
    - PvP is generally prohibited (except in a playful sense), unless two countries have officially Declared War.
    - In a declaration of war, both countries must submit to moderators their intention and war goals. The request is subject to rejection by moderators if the risk of collateral damage to builds is deemed too high. Moderators cannot approve their own wars.
    - Weapons of war (i.e. explosives) must not damage structures within Build Restricted Areas at any time. Minor accidental damage must be repaired at the expense of the attacking party, and major damage must stop the war immediately.
5. Fairness
    - Players may not steal from each other.
    - Players may not damage a structure belonging to other players without permission.
    - Players may not cause any other type of time-scaled loss (for example, deleting OpenComputers code).
    - The preceding rules are void if both parties are At War.
    - Accidental violations do not result in a penalty.
6. Abuse
    - Intentionally attempting to lag or crash the server is not permitted.
    - Exploits must be reported to moderators immediately and use of one is strictly forbidden.
    - Server staff may not use their privileges to gain an unfair gameplay advantage.
        - Staff may teleport themselves, as long as this privilege is not overused.
