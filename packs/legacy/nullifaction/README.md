Nullifaction was a 1.7.10 pack based almost exclusively around tech, experimentally, including barely any tech mods except Reika's (RotaryCraft, ReactorCraft, etc).

It is very similar to the earlier Legacy pack, Uncontainable, even using its same "Chaos" icon, but had been purged of an assortment of mods deemed unnecessary. Unlike its predecessor, it was hosted for the Loiste Community, and barely any players from Uncontainable joined it.
