Uncontainable was a 1.7.10 pack based almost exclusively around tech, including the most common tech mods plus Reika's mod series. Unlike most common packs, it had two independent servers - "Factions", and "Survival". Despite the name, the former was not actually used for Factions gameplay, it was effectively used as a creative build server for the administration.
